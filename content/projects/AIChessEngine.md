For my Artificial Intelligence class at Minerva University I developed a chess engine that can play reasonably well against a human (with ~1900 ELO). The engine has 4 modes: random, minimax with piece valuation, minimax with custom piece evaluation heuristics + positional evaluation heuristic, alphabeta pruning. The engine is fully playable through the [Jupyer Notebook](https://github.com/RisticDjordje/ai-chess-engine/blob/main/ai_chess_engine.ipynb)
